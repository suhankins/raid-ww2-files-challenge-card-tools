# RAID: World War II Files challenge cards tools

Tools used to create challenge card assets and data for [raid-ww2-files](https://github.com/suhankins/raid-ww2-files)

## Requirements

### Software
* [Deno](https://deno.com/) to run createCardsDb
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) to run writeTextOnCards
    * [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) needs to be installed with pip

### Game data

This repo contains most of the game data already (except for font), but if you need to update it:

#### createCardsDb
* `dump.json`. Can be created by installing "dump cards" mod in this repo into the game, running the game, closing it, and finding JSON dump of all cards in the game as a JSON file.
* `strings/inventory.strings` converted to `inventory.json`. Use DieselBundleViewer version that supports compressed bundle, with hashlist that has challenge card stringIDs, and support for 64 bit .string files. You can download all of that [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15zQBTOfEISvNiJVtsKr5H2xTCoCSaZge/view?usp=sharing)

#### writeTextOnCards
* `ui/challenge_cards/` directory, all cards converted from .dds to .png (Can be done with [texconv](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv), with command `texconv *.dds -ft png`)
* `cardsdb.json` generated by createCardsDb
* `DINEngschrift.ttf`
